"""
Verify that a regenerated patch includes all files that failed.

Uses patch_output.txt to determine which files failed for the specific patch,
then checks if those file paths are present in the regenerated patch.

IMPORTANT: This tool checks FILE COVERAGE (are all the files included?), not
CONTENT CORRECTNESS (are the changes right?). Manual review of patch content
is still required to ensure CEF modifications are correct in the new context.

Includes automatic detection of moved/renamed files using git diff.

Usage:
  python3 verify_patch.py patch_output.txt --patch chrome_runtime_views \
    --old-version 142.0.7444.0 --new-version 143.0.7491.0

  python3 verify_patch.py patch_output.txt --patch views_widget \
    --old-version 142.0.7444.0 --new-version 143.0.7491.0 \
    --project-root /path/to/chromium/src
